Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Formalware.

1.13  Thu Oct 27 19:40:00 2005
	- Regenerate META.yml with Module::Build V 0.2611 to correct a faulty
		META.yml output by V 0.24 which falsely said 'provides: {}',
		which in turn stopped the PAUSE indexer from finding the module file,
		which in turn meant this module might be omitted from the master index:
		ftp://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/modules/01modules.index.html

1.12  Mon Jul 19 14:10:00 2004
	- Change Makefile.PL to coexist with Module::Build
	- Delete ./test.pl
	- Rewrite t/test.t to use Test::More
	- Add t/pod.t to test all PODs

1.11  Sun Mar 23 11:29:00 2003
	- Move demos into examples/ directory
	- Change test.xml to use CSS /css/test.css rather than /test.css
	- No source code changes in this version
	- Patch to stop shipping blib/ directory in Unix distros, because the
		PAUSE indexer takes this directory to indicate a binary distro,
		which means it does not index the module, and this in turn means
		the module is not listed in the CPAN daily update list, etc.

1.10  Sun May 12 13:12:11 2002
	- Clean up licence and email stuff in all modules, scripts and other docs.
		Upgrading is not necessary

1.09 29-Jun-2000
----------------
o	Tested under Apache 1.3.12 for Windows, with ActivePerl and with mod_perl.

o	The Table of Contents is now 'live', meaning you can click on a page's
	name to jump to that page.

o	Paragraphs can now have a text attribute. So, both of the following are
	accepted:
		<paragraph />
		<paragraph text = 'Some string' />

o	The number of columns in a radio group can be controlled. So, both of the
	following are accepted:
		<radioGroup
			name		= 'serverName'
			prompt		= 'Server name: '
			value		= 'Example|Simple|Test'
		/>
		<radioGroup
			name		= 'serverName'
			prompt		= 'Server name: '
			value		= 'Example|Simple|Test'
			columns		= '1' # Optional. Default: '1'. A string, not a digit
		/>

o	A file browse button is now available. Use it like this:
		<fileField
			name		= 'fileName'
			prompt		= 'Filename: '
			size		= '60'
			override	= '0'
		/>
	This change requires the use of start_multipart_form(), rather than
	start_form().

o	The initial page, which asks for the name of the XML file, now contains
	more explanatory text.

o	The output of local and remote scripts now have the '<' and '>' characters
	encoded as &lt; and &gt;. This applies particularly to the output of DOS
	directory listings.

o	The documentation has been expanded to spell out exactly which CGI
	functions are supported. These are:
		<fileField ...>
		<horizontalRule ...>
		<paragraph ...>
		<radioGroup ...>
		<textField ...>

o	General code clean-up: Hash items which were 'X' => Y, are now X => Y.
