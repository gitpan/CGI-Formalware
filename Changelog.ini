[V 1.13]
Date=2005-10-27T19:40:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Regenerate META.yml with Module::Build V 0.2611 to correct a faulty
META.yml output by V 0.24 which falsely said 'provides: {}'
which in turn stopped the PAUSE indexer from finding the module file
which in turn meant this module might be omitted from the master index:
ftp://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/modules/01modules.index.html

Date=2004-07-19T14:10:00

EOT

[V 1.11]
Date=2003-03-23T11:29:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Move demos into examples/ directory
- Change test.xml to use CSS /css/test.css rather than /test.css
- No source code changes in this version
- Patch to stop shipping blib/ directory in Unix distros because the
PAUSE indexer takes this directory to indicate a binary distro
which means it does not index the module and this in turn means
the module is not listed in the CPAN daily update list etc.

[V 1.09]
Date=2000-06-29T00:00:00
Comments= <<EOT
----------------
o	Tested under Apache 1.3.12 for Windows with ActivePerl and with mod_perl.
o	The Table of Contents is now 'live' meaning you can click on a page's
name to jump to that page.
o	Paragraphs can now have a text attribute. So both of the following are
accepted:
<paragraph />
<paragraph text = 'Some string' />
o	The number of columns in a radio group can be controlled. So both of the
following are accepted:
<radioGroup
name		= 'serverName'
prompt		= 'Server name: '
value		= 'Example|Simple|Test'
/>
<radioGroup
name		= 'serverName'
prompt		= 'Server name: '
value		= 'Example|Simple|Test'
columns		= '1' # Optional. Default: '1'. A string not a digit
/>
o	A file browse button is now available. Use it like this:
<fileField
name		= 'fileName'
prompt		= 'Filename: '
size		= '60'
override	= '0'
/>
This change requires the use of start_multipart_form() rather than
start_form().
o	The initial page which asks for the name of the XML file now contains
more explanatory text.
o	The output of local and remote scripts now have the '<' and '>' characters
encoded as &lt; and &gt;. This applies particularly to the output of DOS
directory listings.
o	The documentation has been expanded to spell out exactly which CGI
functions are supported. These are:
<fileField ...>
<horizontalRule ...>
<paragraph ...>
<radioGroup ...>
<textField ...>
o	General code clean-up: Hash items which were 'X' => Y are now X => Y.
